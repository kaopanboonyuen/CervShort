## 🔬 Overview

Deep learning systems for cervical cytology often achieve high in-domain accuracy while silently relying on **non-pathological shortcuts**, such as staining variations, illumination drift, slide preparation artifacts, or background debris. These hidden dependencies can severely degrade performance when models are deployed across hospitals, scanners, or laboratories.

**CervShort** is a domain-aware training framework designed to **explicitly disrupt shortcut learning** in cervical cancer cytology classifiers. Instead of encouraging models to fit dataset-specific cues, CervShort promotes **morphology-grounded, distribution-stable representations** that generalize across clinical centers and imaging conditions.

---

## ✨ Key Ideas

CervShort introduces a principled strategy for shortcut mitigation tailored to cytology data:

### 1. Tri-Path Feature Purification

The network disentangles competing sources of information by learning three complementary feature streams:

* **Cell-centric morphology path** focuses on nucleus–cytoplasm structure and cellular shape.
* **Artifact-suppression path** reduces sensitivity to acquisition-dependent degradations.
* **Distribution-stable path** enforces alignment across staining and illumination variations.

### 2. Artifact-Shift Augmentation

To expose hidden shortcuts during training, CervShort simulates **realistic lab-dependent perturbations** and treats them as adversarial signals, encouraging the model to ignore spurious correlations.

### 3. Robustness-Oriented Learning Objective

Prototype alignment and invariance constraints are applied to promote **cross-center consistency** without sacrificing diagnostic sensitivity.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

* Improves **generalization across hospitals and scanners**
* Reduces **artifact-driven misclassification**
* Produces **interpretable attention maps** grounded in cellular morphology
* Addresses reliability and fairness concerns in **population-scale cervical cancer screening**

CervShort is designed with **real clinical deployment** in mind, where robustness is as critical as accuracy.

---

## 📊 Experimental Highlights

* Evaluated on large-scale cervical cytology datasets with multi-center variation
* Consistently outperforms standard ERM and augmentation-based baselines under domain shift
* Demonstrates strong resilience to staining, illumination, and background artifacts

(Full experimental details are provided in the accompanying paper.)
